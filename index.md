Hello World this is my personal Portfolio. Displaying all my progress and work I've 
done here at Cal State Fullerton and I major in Computer Science

### CSPC120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 was a good lab especially with me and my partner finishing so smoothly.
    We each took turns switching coding and it felt pretty straightforward.
    We especially enjoyed figuring out the formula for the black jack function in part 2.
    I also liked playing around with the program a little and seeing all the different combinations
    for the Black Jack magic rule.

* Lab 8

    In this lab, we had seen something familiar before in the sandwich file.
     What stuck out to me was how this time I was able to code it again
     a second time without having to use my notes or previous code as much.
     In part 1 I liked playing around with the sandwich program. It was like 
    a little game and I was enjoying what I had just worked on and
    it gave me hope to see what I could make in the future.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9 part 2 was a little tricky at first figuring out how the two philosophers could sleep at the same time.
    It was really a simple alghotrithim but I made a few mistakes in the fact that I had waited to compile at the very end
    and got lost in my work. I then thought back to my professor and realized that I should just take it nice and steady and work at each line
    one at a time and it ended up compiling smoother.
